text with 0 indentation

    text with 1 indentation. 1 is greater than the preceding 0, but we need to parse the next element before we know.
    another line with more text with 1 indentation.

    even some more text with 1 indentation, preceded by a blank line, and next non-whitespace, non-comment element has indentation LOWER OR EQUAL to this one  --> this is a paragraph open.

    here is a new line with 1 indentation, preceded by a blank line, BUT, next non-WS non comment element has a greater indentation level. Therefore, this is a H2. 

        Some paragraph opener under the H2 heading from before, with an indentation level of 2.
        Lorem ipsum a new div in the same paragraph because no blank line before it and indent level is also 2.

        Foo text after a blank line with same indentation (2) as the preceding text; it is another paragraph opener under the H2 from before.

    Back to indentation level 1. Note that the next line has a greater indentation than the current one. This necessarily makes this line a heading.
        This line has indentation level 2. Because 1 is LOWER THAN 2, the previous line is a heading (h2), and since the next element has a LOWER indentation level, this is a paragraph start with a single div.

    Back to indentation level 1. Next line has the same indentation.
    Here is another line, right afterwards, with the SAME indentation level (1). This is a special case; read the comment below.
