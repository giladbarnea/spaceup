text with 0 indentation

    text with 1 indentation. 1 is greater than the preceding 0, but we need to parse the next element before we know.
    another line with more text with 1 indentation.

    even some more text with 1 indentation, preceded by a blank line, and next non-whitespace, non-comment element has indentation LOWER OR EQUAL to this one  --> this is a paragraph open.

    here is a new line with 1 indentation, preceded by a blank line, BUT, next non-WS non comment element has a greater indentation level. Therefore, this is a H2. 

        Some paragraph opener under the H2 heading from before, with an indentation level of 2.
        Lorem ipsum a new div in the same paragraph because no blank line before it and indent level is also 2.

        Foo text after a blank line with same indentation (2) as the preceding text; it is another paragraph opener under the H2 from before.
