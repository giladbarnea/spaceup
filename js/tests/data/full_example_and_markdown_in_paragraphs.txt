text with 0 indentation

    text with 1 indentation, with **bold** and a link to [site](https://example.com).
    another line with more text with 1 indentation and some *emphasis*.

    even some more text with 1 indentation, preceded by a blank line, and next non-whitespace, non-comment element has indentation LOWER OR EQUAL to this one  --> this is a paragraph open.

    here is a new line with 1 indentation, preceded by a blank line, BUT, next non-WS non comment element has a greater indentation level. Therefore, this is a H2. 

        - First step: mix ingredients
        - Use **butter** and [sugar](https://example.com/sugar)

        Some paragraph opener under the H2 heading from before, with an indentation level of 2, and a link to [docs](https://example.com/docs).
        Lorem ipsum a new div in the same paragraph because no blank line before it and indent level is also 2 with **strong** text.

        Foo text after a blank line with same indentation (2) as the preceding text; it is another paragraph opener under the H2 from before with a [link](https://example.com/foo).

    Back to indentation level 1. Note that the next line has a greater indentation than the current one. This necessarily makes this line a heading.
        This line has indentation level 2. Because 1 is LOWER THAN 2, the previous line is a heading (h2), and since the next element has a LOWER indentation level, this is a paragraph start with a single div.

    Back to indentation level 1. Next line has the same indentation with *italic* and a link to [spec](https://example.com/spec).
    Here is another line, right afterwards, with the SAME indentation level (1). This is a special case; read the comment below.
    // This text block is the first example where the two following conditions occur:
    // 1. indentation went DOWN (previous non-ws non-comment element was 2; now it's 1), and
    // 2. Two consecutive elements have the same indentation level (1), and going by rules, the first line of this block — 'Back to indentation level 1' — shouldn't be a heading. But we have to make an exception here.
    // In such an ambiguous, decreased-indentation case, where it's unclear how to parse the first line because the line which follows it shares the same indentation level, the first line is FORCED to become a heading. Subsequent lines in this block are forced to be indented. In effect, this makes this block with exactly the same structure as the one before it; an h2 line, followed by a paragraph starter.
