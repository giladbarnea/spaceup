<h1>text with 0 indentation</h1>
<p>
    text with 1 indentation. 1 is greater than the preceding 0, but we need to parse the next element before we know.  <!-- hint: the following non-WS, non-comment element's indentation level is LOWER OR EQUAL to this one; therefore, this line is a paragraph open. --><br>
    another line with more text with 1 indentation.<br>
</p>
<p>
    even some more text with 1 indentation, preceded by a blank line, and next non-whitespace, non-comment element has indentation LOWER OR EQUAL to this one  --> this is a paragraph open.<br>
</p>
<h2>here is a new line with 1 indentation, preceded by a blank line, BUT, next non-WS non comment element has a greater indentation level. Therefore, this is a H2.</h2>
<p>
    Some paragraph opener under the H2 heading from before, with an indentation level of 2.<br>
    Lorem ipsum a new div in the same paragraph because no blank line before it and indent level is also 2.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Foo text after a blank line with same indentation (2) as the preceding text; it is another paragraph opener under the H2 from before.<br>
</p>
<h2>Back to indentation level 1. Note that the next line has a greater indentation than the current one. This necessarily makes this line a heading.</h2>
<p>
    This line has indentation level 2. Because 1 is LOWER THAN 2, the previous line is a heading (h2), and since the next element has a LOWER indentation level, this is a paragraph start with a single div.<br>
</p>
<h2>Back to indentation level 1. Next line has the same indentation.</h2>
<p>
    Here is another line, right afterwards, with the SAME indentation level (1). This is a special case; read the comment below.<br>
</p>
<!-- This text block is the first example where the two following conditions occur: -->
<!-- 1. indentation went DOWN (previous non-ws non-comment element was 2; now it's 1), and -->
<!-- 2. Two consecutive elements have the same indentation level (1), and going by rules, the first line of this block — 'Back to indentation level 1' — shouldn't be a heading. But we have to make an exception here. -->
<!-- In such an ambiguous, decreased-indentation case, where it's unclear how to parse the first line because the line which follows it shares the same indentation level, the first line is FORCED to become a heading. Subsequent lines in this block are forced to be indented. In effect, this makes this block with exactly the same structure as the one before it; an h2 line, followed by a paragraph starter. -->
